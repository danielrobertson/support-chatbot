# Customer Support Chatbot

A Facebook Messenger chatbot built with IBM Watson for a generic internet provider that can answer questions, schedule appointments, and file reports to improve customer experience and allow customer service representatives to focus on more important issues.

Build using IBM Watson for natural language processing, Node.js and Botkit for the server requests, Facebook Messenger SDK, IBM Cloudant for data storage, and hosted on the IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix).

## Usage

## Frequently asked questions

Cloudant has FAQ and answers which Watson can match with

## Schedule appointments

Book an appointment

## Technical Assistance

a picture of modem/router, information about that device

give a real-time status report of outages

## Request a human

Confirm phone number and have a sales or technical specialist call you back

## Motivation

### Learning opportunity

I chose IBM Watson as the natural language processing. IBM Watson's capability to create conversational flows and how to integrate Watson with server-side processing using Node.js

### A demonstration of better customer experience

I think many would agree that sitting on the telephone for upwards of 30 minutes to speak with a support representative is less than ideal, especially if there are limited hours of operations for the call centers.

By building chat chat onto a platform that many already use daily such as Facebook Messenger, text message, etc.,

## Why AI Chatbot

* Rapid answers because chatbots don’t need to sleep.

* Less groundwork required to cover a high volume of requests. No more long waiting time on telephones for similar responses.

* Fewer errors because cognitive technology interprets customers’ responses and provides accurate, automated answers. Chatbots have a lot of memory. This reduces the chances of misinterpreting a query or offering an incorrect solution.

* Increased customer engagement

* Proactive customer interactions by beginning the conversation and inform customers about sales and promotions.

* Handling simple transactions
